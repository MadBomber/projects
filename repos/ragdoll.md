## Backlog

Well-defined items a single small PR could close. Bomberbot works these before anything else in this repo.

- **Get the `develop` test suite green.** Added 2026-11-05.
  - **Evidence:** CI run https://github.com/MadBomber/ragdoll/actions/runs/42141192445 fails with 3 failures and 322 errors. `main` is green.
  - **Cause:** the January `anyway_config` migration (6783eb6) left `ImageDescriptionService` and `ImageToTextService` calling `ragdoll_config.ruby_llm_config`, which `Ragdoll::Core::Config` no longer defines. See the FIXME at `app/services/ragdoll/image_description_service.rb:147`. Merging `main` into `develop` (6e80890) added 2 more errors on top of the 320 already present at 0ebbbaf.
  - **Reproduce:** `RAGDOLL_SKIP_DATABASE_TESTS=true bundle exec rake test` on `develop`, under Ruby 4.0.9. Ruby 4.1.0-preview1 crashes Bundler on the gemspec with `uninitialized constant Pathname::SEPARATOR_PAT`.
  - **Size:** likely more than one PR. Start with the `ruby_llm_config` callers, the biggest single cause, and take the merge-introduced errors as their own small PR if they are separate.
